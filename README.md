The Code is written by using LoopPass where we iterate over all the loops in the program one by one.
Below resources were used to aid as a tutrorial for the lab:

Writing LLVM code: http://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html
LLVM Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKIv_Bkp4pk
Loop Terminology: http://llvm.org/docs/LoopTerminology.html#loop-terminology

Additionally below files were used to understand different classes and their member functions:

LoopInfo.h:	https://llvm.org/doxygen/LoopInfo_8h_source.html
BasicBlock.h: 	https://llvm.org/doxygen/BasicBlock_8h_source.html
Instruction.h: 	https://llvm.org/doxygen/IR_2Instruction_8h_source.html
